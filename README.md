# Tic-Tac-Toe with AI

This is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game built using React. The project was inspired by a tutorial video by CodingWith-Adam, with added logic for a random AI response.

## Features
- Play against a simple AI that makes random moves.
- Tracks game state and highlights winning combinations.
- Sounds for clicks and game over events.
- Reset button to start a new game.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/tic-tac-toe-React.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd tic-tac-toe-react
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
4. Start the development server:
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```

## How It Works
- The game alternates between player (X) and AI (O).
- The AI picks a random available tile for its move.
- The game ends when a player wins or there is a draw.

## Credits
This project was built while following [this video](https://github.com/CodingWith-Adam/tic-tac-toe-react) by CodingWith-Adam as a learning resource. Additional logic was implemented to allow the AI to make random moves.
